# Mobile Price Classification
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification <br>
In this project, I performed statistical analysis and visualization on the given data using Scipy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Altair libraries.
Also, I used different Logistic Regression Models for price prediction after normalizing the data using methods such as PCA and different Scalers.<br>
Plots are powerful tools for discovering relations and analyzing. From the plot below, the direct relation between ram and price_range can result.<br>

In the next step, I did a cleaning of the data. After that, I designed multiple Logistic Regression Models (using PCA, Forward/Backward Selection, Data Normalization, ...) to reach a better result.<br> 
You can see the confusion matrix of one of the models below with an accuracy of %85.<br>
